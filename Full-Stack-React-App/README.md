# Full-Stack-React-App
Simple full-stack web application using AWS Amplify.

## Project overview 
Full-stack web application using AWS Amplify. I explored how Amplify provides a Git-based CI/CD workflow for building, deploying, and hosting single-page web applications or static sites with serverless backends. 

### Key Features: 
- Build and host a React application on AWS.
- Use Amplify to add authentication, data & storage solutions to the app.
- Start a cloud sandbox environment to build, test, and iterate on a fullstack app.
- Automatic fund release when the funding goal is reached.
- Implement the frontend code to enable users to create, update, and delete notes.
